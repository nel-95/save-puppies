 		<h2>Who are we and what do we do?</h2>
    	<p>There are thousands of stray dogs on the streets of Romania. Everyday, many die on the streets beaten, poisoned or starved. When they end up in public shelters, the care is so poor that plenty of them die from injuries or sickness. We are a group of volunteers who came together with an aim to save as many of these dogs as possible by giving them a chance to find their new cosy home in the UK. </p>

				<h3><a href="https://www.paypal.com/auth/validatecaptcha"> Donate</a> </h3>
				<p class="donate"> Dog rescue work is costly: getting food and treatment to the dogs most in need, arranging the health checks and vaccinations before they travel, and especially the transport costs to the UK. We can't do it without people like you and your donations of time and money. We have lots of fundraising schemes to take part in: facebook auctions, a monthly lottery and pledges to help each dog make it to its new forever home in the UK. We also need volunteers to help with transport and homechecks. We have so much work on our hands, and there is plenty you can do to help us!</p>

				<h3><a href="Apply.html"> Foster or adopt</a> </h3>
     			<p class="adopt">Out of thousands of dogs, only a few will be plucked to safety by rescue groups like SRS.  Once we have found a foster home for a dog, or someone to adopt a dog, the wheels are set in motion to raise funds to transport it to the UK. They are neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, checked by a vet and given a passport to travel. Fosterers are given full support from SRS until a permanent home is found. We are always looking for new fosterers to join the dog rescue work and get these dogs out of the shelters, off the streets and ready to be adopted. If you want to know how to help us or rescue a dog then contact us on <a class= "FosterorAdopt" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/674018512672744/""> <strong>Facebook!</strong> </a> </p>
